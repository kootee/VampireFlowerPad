## Building

Simply run `cmake -B build` and `cmake --build build`. This builds the executable in `./build/bin/`.

The exact location of the executable may differ depending on your system and compiler. Example locations are `./build/bin/survive` and `./build/bin/Debug/survive.exe`.

Alternatively, you can specify a generator suited for your toolchain.
- `cmake -B build -G"Unix Makefiles"`
- `cmake -B build -G"Visual Studio 17 2022"`
- `cmake -B build -GXcode`

Run `cmake -G` to list all available generators.
